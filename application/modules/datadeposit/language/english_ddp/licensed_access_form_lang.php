The datasets shall not be redistributed to other individuals, institutions or organizations without the Microdata Library's prior written consent and only subject to such conditions as may accompany such consent. </li>
<li>The data will be used for World Bank related business use only. They will be used solely for generating and perhaps reporting, aggregated information and not for investigations into specific individuals or organizations. In other words, the data shall be treated as a finished product - it may be used as a foundation for further work, but no reverse engineering or &quot;upstream research&quot; into the sources of the data itself will be permitted.</li>
<li>No attempt will be made to identify respondents or microdata providers, and no use will be made of the identity of any person, facility or establishment discovered inadvertently. Any such discovery would immediately be reported to the Microdata Library, to allow us to evaluate further use, apply further statistical disclosure control methods, impose further restrictions on access, or appropriately re-classify the data.  </li>
<li>No attempt will be made to create links among datasets provided by the Microdata Library or among data from the Microdata Library and other datasets with the intended purpose of identify individuals or organizations.  </li>
<li>Any books, articles, conference papers, theses, dissertations, reports or other publications employing data obtained from the Microdata Library will cite the source, in line with the citation requirement provided with the dataset.  </li>
<li>The Microdata Library and the relevant funding agencies bear no responsibility for the data's use or for interpretation or inferences based upon it.  </li>
<li>As a condition to access Licensed Files, the principal and other researchers who will be involved in using the data must be identified. The principal researcher may be asked to sign a license. Any violation of the Microdata Terms of Use may result in measures to sanction such misconduct, which may include denying any further and future access to other Licensed Files in the Microdata Library.  </li>
<li>The intended use of the data, including a list of expected outputs must be identified and no additional uses shall be permitted without prior written consent from the Microdata Library. </li>
</ol>
<p>By continuing past this point to the data retrieval process, you signify your agreement to comply with the above-stated terms and conditions and give your assurance that the use of statistical data obtained from the Microdata Library will conform to widely-accepted standards of practice and legal restrictions that are intended to protect the confidentiality of respondents.</p>";
